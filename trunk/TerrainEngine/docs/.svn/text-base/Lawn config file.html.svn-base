	<h1>A guide to Lawn's configuration file</h1>
	<p>
	Everything at the Lawn (i.e. not OGRE) level is stored in <b>config.xml</b>.
	There are several values in here.  Some are not a good idea to touch unless
	you have specific needs, others may be essential to get Lawn running in
	a sensible fashion on your hardware.
	</p>
	<h1>Terrain Fields</h1>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Location:</b> Where to load terrain from.
	
	<li><b>QuadtreeLevels:</b> The number of levels of detail Lawn assumes
	will be in the terrain if the terrain files themselves do not tell it otherwise.
	This will probably have no effect unless you have an early version of Lawn
	or a particularly broken terrain.

	<li><b>Scale:</b> The length of a single terrain quad at the default level
	of detail (i.e. where a 1:1 mapping between terrain quads and heightmap
	pixels exists).  This will usually be set by the terrain file.
	</ul>

	<h1>LOD (Level of Detail) Fields</h1>
	
	<ul>
	<li><b>TileSize:</b> The size of tile (in <i>vertices per edge</i>) Lawn
	will attempt to employ.  It is probably a good idea to make this a power of
	two for maximal GPU compatibility.  Smaller numbers are better if your
	CPU is faster than your GPU; larger numbers are better if your GPU is
	faster as they will result in fewer calculations but more polygons on screen
	for a given level of detail.
	<li><b>MaxStack:</b> At low levels it will probably not be necessary
	for the user to see large distances, and thus the associated tiles will not
	need to be drawn.  This sets the maximum allowable difference between
	the lowest and highest levels of drawn quadtree.
	<li><b>MinLOD:</b> The lowest level of detail available.  If you're
	really having performance problems you can raise this.
	<li><b>Error:</b> This is a bias value used to alter the general detail
	of selected tiles.  Higher values express a preference for lower tile detail,
	and thus give better performance.
	</ul>
